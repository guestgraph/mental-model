# German left behind is found

> A pull request to guestgraph.io fails where an English edit left its German unchanged, unless a commit says the German is right on purpose.

## How it is carried out

The site's CI, on every pull request, in the `verify` job the ruleset requires: `design german stale` compares the change with its base and fails for each element whose English moved while its German did not; a commit that names the element in a `German-unchanged:` trailer releases it.

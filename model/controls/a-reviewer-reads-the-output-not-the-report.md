# A reviewer reads the output, not the report

> Each task's change is reviewed against its diff and the checks' output, and the implementer's report is read as a claim to verify.

## How it is carried out

The Reviewer, after each task in Implement and once over the whole branch at the start of Integrate: it reads the diff and the output of the checks the task ran, verifies each claim of the report against them, and names a gap as a finding; a check whose output it cannot see does not count as passed.

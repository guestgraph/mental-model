# Main takes a change only through a green, current pull request

> The default branch of each of our repositories refuses a push, and takes a change only through a pull request whose named checks pass on a branch that is up to date with it, merged with a merge commit.

## How it is carried out

GitHub's ruleset on each repository's default branch, on every attempt to change it: it refuses a force push and a deletion, takes a change only through a pull request, requires the named checks to pass, and requires the branch to be up to date with the default branch, so a pull request whose base has moved shows as behind until main is merged into it. A pull request merges only with a merge commit: in each repository either the ruleset allows no other merge method or the repository's settings turn squash and rebase off, so a commit reaches main under the author it was made with. The ruleset lets a repository admin bypass it, except on service-conventions.

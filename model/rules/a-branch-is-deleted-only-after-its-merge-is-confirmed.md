# A branch is deleted only after its merge is confirmed

> A branch is deleted as a step of its own, once its merge is confirmed, and never chained after the merge.

## Why

A delete chained after a merge runs even when the merge fails, and deleting a pull request's branch closes it, so a merge that failed would lose the change it was meant to take.

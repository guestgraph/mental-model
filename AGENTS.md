<!-- conventions · v1.31.0 -->
Shared conventions of the robertblust, guestgraph and companygraph organizations live in `conventions/`, vendored from robertblust/conventions at the release `conventions.json` names. Read them before writing or committing anything here.

- `conventions/WRITING.md` — how we write: one voice, three registers, English and German.
- `conventions/WORKING.md` — how we work with git and GitHub.
- `conventions/REPOSITORIES.md` — the family: what each repository is and what pins what.
- `conventions/WRITER.md`, `conventions/TRANSLATOR.md`, `conventions/EDITOR.md`,
  `conventions/BACKREADER.md`, `conventions/GLOSSARY.md`, `conventions/GERMAN.md` — the four roles
  that make a text, the terms they keep and the German they write.

Everything below this block is this repository's own. `sh conventions/conventions-sync check` says whether the copy matches the release, `sync` brings it to the release the pin names, and `sh conventions/conventions-check` holds this repository's own Markdown to `WRITING.md`, and `sh conventions/conventions-format` to its one form, which `fix` writes. Edit a shared file in robertblust/conventions, never here.

# GuestGraph — working conventions

This repository is a CompanyGraph instance. The rules it is held to are vendored under `meta/core/`, and `meta/core/CONVENTIONS.md` is the one to read before writing anything here: one file per entity, a reference written as a canonical name, and a schema for every type under the same folder.

The mechanical half of those rules is checked by CI, and locally by `npx github:companygraph/meta-model#v<tooling> check`, where `<tooling>` is the release `.companygraph/manifest.json` names. What no check reads is each schema's `## Writing rules`, which an agent judges by reading them against the entity: the `companygraph-validate` skill runs both halves. `companygraph-export` packages the model for an agent and for Gemini Notebook, and `companygraph-surface` produces a surface the model records; both need Python 3. `companygraph-profile` builds a profile, or extends one, from a folder of the person's documents. All of them are the tooling's and move with an upgrade, so an instance's own skills go beside them under another name.

Everything below this line is this instance's own: how it is written, what it does not claim, and where its facts are mastered.
